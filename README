README for perl module Devel::Fail::Make

This module was created as a debugging aid for mechanized module
installers such as CPAN and CPANPLUS.

* `perl Makefile.PL` will run fine and create a good Makefile.

* `make` will fail.  You should see a message like
  "'deliberate_failure' is not recognized as an internal or external
  command, operable program or batch file."

* `make test` will succeed if you dare to try it.

* `make install` will succeed (without actually installing anything).
